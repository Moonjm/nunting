/// so the user scrolls into cache hits without reintroducing the burst the
/// gate exists to prevent.
///
/// Bounded + dedup'd: each URL is prefetched at most once, and only `window`
/// ahead of the most-recently-seen image are ever in flight. Low priority
/// means on-screen (gated / eager) fetches always win the downloader's
/// concurrency slots — prefetch fills idle capacity only.
